Overview

Origin Field Theory (OFT) proposes that existence arises from an atemporal interaction between Consciousness and an infinite Origin Field of potential law configurations.
Rather than a temporal creation event, OFT introduces the Focus Operator — a non-temporal conditioning relation that transforms pure potential into stable, law-governed universes.

Core Concepts

Origin Field: The total set of possible law configurations — the substrate of all potential realities.

Consciousness: The selection and stabilization process that focuses potential into form.

Focus Operator: The mathematical functional mapping potential states to stable universes.

Stability Functional: A measure balancing logical self-consistency, simplicity, observer capacity, and fragility.

Atemporal Emergence: Time is not fundamental but arises as an ordering on stability manifolds.

Goals

OFT aims to explain:

1. Why laws exist and why they are stable.

2. Why observers arise within those laws.

3. How universes self-organize from pure potential.

4. The bridge between information theory, cosmology, and consciousness.

Mathematical Framework

OFT is formalized as a measure-theoretic model:

> μ₀(U) ∝ 2⁻ᴷ(U)

S(Θ) = α·Consistency + β·Simplicity + γ·Observer Capacity − δ·Fragility

Universes are selected as stability maxima of this functional — analogous to equilibrium states in physics.

Research Applications

Cosmology (law selection, multiverse dynamics)

Quantum foundations (observer-dependent state reduction)

Information theory (complexity measures, algorithmic priors)

Philosophy of mind (consciousness as a physical operator)
